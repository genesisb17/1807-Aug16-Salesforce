                <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Tamara Wertheim. I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University May of 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering. I hope to improve my skills over time, espeically in web design in development. My favorite thing I learned was a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoyed how they interact with each other. They remind me of the human body: <body class=":">
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>HTML is like the skeletal system. The bones, or rather elements, are structured and connected together.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>JavaScript is like the nervous system. The brain is connected to nerves. It tells the body what to do and how to perform it. JavaScript tells the elements how to perform their tasks.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>CSS is like the integumentary system. The integumentary system includes skin, hair, nails, and many other things. CSS is the design of the website. It has more compared to HTML on its own.</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
            <br>
        </h2>
        </div>
    </body>
