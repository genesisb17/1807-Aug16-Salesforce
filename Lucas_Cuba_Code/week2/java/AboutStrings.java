    The String class represents characters strung together. String literal is "". Strings are immutable

    new Strings can be created in two ways:
    String str = "This is a string"; //lives in string pool
    String str2 = new String("string"); //lives in the heap
    new will create a new object every time it is called even if the string exists in me
