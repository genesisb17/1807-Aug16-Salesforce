/*Project 0 - Due during QC on Wed 8/1
create a client side application that does the following:
- uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap*, JS/jQuery, AJAX
- is styled and visually appealing (yes, subjective, but what would masses consume)
- clearly employs one of the CSS layout modes discussed (flex, grid, etc)
- has DOM manipulation using JS(or jQuery)
- consumes an API using AJAX(either public api or using JSON server)*/
