public class AboutStrings{
    /*
    The String class represents character strings. 
    All string literals in Java ("like this") are
    implemented as instances of this class
    Strings are immutable - their values cannt be 
    changed once they are initialized.
    We use StringBuffer and StringBuilder as mutable
    versions of String
    new Strings can be created in two ways:
    String str = "This is a string"; //lives in string pool
    String str2 = new String("String"); //lives in the heap. 
            the "new" keyword will create a new object every    
            time it is called even if the string exists
            in memory already
