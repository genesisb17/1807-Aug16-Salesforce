        <p>Hello, I'm Harvey Hill. I am presently living in Virginia. I love dogs, especially basset hounds, comics,
            movies, and any number of other assorted geeky pursuits. I like to read, write, draw, and above all create. I
            am a game designer.</p>

        <p>When I was around six my father brought home an NES. While he set it up in what used to be my older sisterâ€™s room,
            who was then at college, I eagerly waited outside the door while he took a suspiciously long time to get it set
            up. After around an hour he opened the door and I marveled at the T.V. with Super Mario Bros. running on it.
            Before letting me or my sister play it he insisted on showing us how it was done, and promptly ran straight into
            the first goomba. I cannot recall him ever playing again after that day, but for me I was hooked the moment I
            grasped the controller in my hand.</p>

        <p>My hobby playing games would eventually become a passion for creation, first introduced through map editors and modding
            tools. I found it more fun to create than it was to play, and so when the opportunity came I went back to school
            to pursue that passion. I graduated from Full Sail University in October of 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Game Design. 
            When not busy with my day job I work on a number of side projects. These range from
            Exemplar, a table top role playing game, and creating small games in unity for practice and fun.</p>

        <img style="float: left; width: 30%" src="../images/exemplar.png" alt="exemplar logo"></img><p>I am a creative mind with a tendency towards using lateral thinking to solve problems and have a desire for excellence
            in everything I do. Along with these traits I bring an eagerness and passion to create, a willingness and ability
            to be flexible and fill whatever role is needed by the team or work independently as a the situation requires.
            I seek to meet and exceed expectations while mainitaining a professional and courteous attitude.</p>
