                <h2>Favorite Topic of the Week</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed learning javascript, more so then html and css, but I liked html and css as well. I look forward to seeing how
                    much I can do with javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>Favorite Thing to Code</h2>
                <p>Picking a favorite coding and design language is very difficult for me. For larger projects I prefer, a well
                    developed object oriented language such as Java or C#. The amount of features that come with the languages
                    speeds up the development time greatly, and the OOP design allows the project to grow naturally. For
                    simple projects, I might prefer to work in javascript as something I can just throw into a console and
                    output results. For rojects that require fine control of the computer or limited overhead I would choose
                    C.
                </p>
                <p>The Languages I'm most comfortable with are C and Java, as I have spent a lot of time working in these languages.
                    After that, I would prefer any imperative languages would be prefered over a purely functional language.</p>

                <h2>What I Hope to Gain</h2>
                <p>My primary resaon for coming to Revature is because it will give me good career options. Hopefully by the
                    end of training I will be able to call myself a full stack developer.
